# Shawn's UserScripts

These are scripts that make my day to day a bit better. Most of them are not well written.

## Scripts

### Banner Usability Fixes

Banner has awful formatting by default. This script adjusts the formatting so class info spans multiple lines, but doesn't use double line breaks. Additionally, a show all
option is added to the pagination drop down. Around 150 classes will make your browser upset.

### Realm Hint 

RIS doesn't store ADFS realm hints. This script automatically enters DSU as your domain and clicks next for you.

### D2L Save and Next Button

Changes the functionality of the "Next Student" button in the grade view of D2L to "Save and Next." Also will open the first matching document.
